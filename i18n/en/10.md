# Chapter 10 Treatment

(1) Determine the treatment place according to the condition.
1. Suspected and confirmed cases should be isolated and treated in designated hospitals with effective isolation and protection conditions. Suspected cases should be treated in isolation and in a single room. Multiple confirmed cases can be admitted to the same ward.
2. Critical cases should be admitted to ICU as soon as possible.

(2) Yiyong was treated.
1. Rest in bed, strengthen supportive treatment to ensure sufficient heat; pay attention to water and electrolyte balance to maintain internal environment stability; closely monitor vital signs, oxygen saturation, etc.

2. Monitor blood routine, urine routine, CRP, biochemical indicators (liver enzyme, myocardial enzyme, renal function, etc.), coagulation function, arterial blood gas analysis, chest imaging, etc. according to the condition. If possible, cytokine detection is feasible.

3. Provide effective oxygen therapy in time, including nasal cannula, mask oxygen and transnasal high-flow oxygen therapy. Conditions can be treated with hydrogen and oxygen inhalation gas (time 02:66. Called 33.3%) treatment.

4. Antiviral therapy: try a-interferon (5 million U or equivalent per adult, add sterilized water for injection 2 resistance, 2 times daily aerosol inhalation), lopinavir / ritonavir (adult 20 0mg / S 0mg / capsule, 2 capsules each time, 2 times a day, the course of treatment does not exceed 10 days), ribavirin (recommended with interferon or lopinavir / ritona
Combined use of Wei, 500mg / time for adults, 2 to 3 intravenous infusions per day, the course of treatment does not exceed 10 days), chlorophosphonium phosphate (18-65-year-old adults. Those who weigh more than 50 kg, 500 mg each time, 2 daily The treatment lasts for 7 days; for patients weighing less than 50 kg, 500 mg each time on the first and second days, twice daily, and 50 Oing each time on the third to seventh days, once daily; 3 times a day for less than 10 days). Attention should be paid to the adverse reactions of the above drugs, contraindications (such as chlorothiazide contraindication in patients with heart disease), and interaction with other drugs. To further evaluate the efficacy of the currently tested drugs in clinical applications. It is not recommended to use 3 or more antiviral drugs at the same time, and the use of related drugs should be stopped when there are intolerable side effects. For the treatment of pregnant women, the number of weeks of pregnancy should be considered, and as far as possible, drugs that have a small impact on the fetus, and whether to treat after termination of pregnancy should be informed and informed.

5. Antimicrobial treatment: Avoid blind or inappropriate use of antimicrobials, especially in combination with broad-spectrum antimicrobials.

(3) Treatment of severe and critical cases.
1. Treatment principle: Based on symptomatic treatment, actively prevent complications, treat basic diseases, prevent secondary infections, and provide organ function support in a timely manner.

2. Respiratory support:
(1) Oxygen therapy: Severe patients should receive nasal cannula or mask to inhale oxygen, and timely evaluate whether respiratory distress and / or hypoxemia is relieved.
(2) High-flow nasal catheter oxygen therapy or non-invasive mechanical ventilation: when patients have respiratory distress and / or hypoxemia cannot be relieved after receiving standard oxygen therapy, high-flow can be considered
Nasal catheter oxygen therapy or non-invasive ventilation. If the condition does not improve or worsens within a short time (1-2 hours), tracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation should be performed in time.
(3) Invasive mechanical ventilation: use lung protective ventilation strategy, that is, small tidal volume (6-8mL / kg ideal body weight) and low level airway platform pressure (extended 3OcmH2O) for mechanical ventilation to reduce ventilator-related lung injury. 35cnil-12 is autoclaved at the guaranteed airway platform. At this time, high PEEP can be appropriately used to keep the airway warm and humid, avoid prolonged sedation, wake up patients early and perform lung rehabilitation treatment. Many patients have human-machine synchronization, and sedation and muscle relaxants should be used in time. According to the airway secretions, closed sputum suction is selected, and if necessary, bronchoscopy is performed to take corresponding treatment.
(4) Salvage treatment: For patients with severe ARDS, lung expansion is recommended.
In the case of sufficient human resources, prone ventilation should be performed for more than 12 hours per day. If prone position mechanical ventilation is not effective, if conditions permit, extracorporeal membrane pulmonary oxygenation (ECMO) should be considered as soon as possible. Related indications: ① When Fi02> 90%, oxygen
The composite index is less than 80 inmHg and lasts for more than 3-4 hours;
35cmH20. For patients with simple respiratory failure, the VV-ECMO mode is preferred; if circulatory support is required, the VA-ECMO mode is used. When the underlying disease is under control and cardiopulmonary function shows signs of recovery, weaning trials can begin.

3. Circulation support: on the basis of adequate fluid resuscitation, improve microcirculation, use vasoactive drugs, closely monitor changes in patients' blood pressure, heart rate and urine volume, and lactic acid and alkali residuals in arterial blood gas analysis. Invasive hemodynamic monitoring, such as echo Doppler, echocardiography, invasive blood pressure or continuous
Cardiac output (P1CC 0) was monitored. In the treatment process, pay attention to the liquid balance strategy to avoid overdose and underdose.
If it is found that the patient's sudden increase in heart rate is greater than 20% of the baseline value or that the blood pressure is reduced by more than 20% of the baseline value, if accompanied by symptoms such as poor skin perfusion and decreased urine output, the patient should be closely observed for septic shock, digestion Road bleeding or heart work
Can fail and other conditions.

4. Renal failure and renal replacement therapy: Renal impairment in critically ill patients should actively look for the causes of renal impairment, such as hypoperfusion and drugs. For the treatment of patients with renal failure, attention should be paid to body fluid balance, acid-base balance and electrolyte balance, and nutritional support treatment should pay attention to nitrogen balance, calories and trace elements supplement. Severe patients can choose continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Its indications include: ① hyperkalemia; ② acidosis; ③ pulmonary edema or excessive water load; ④ fluids with multiple organ dysfunction
management.

5. Plasma therapy for recoverers: It is suitable for patients with rapid disease progression, severe and critically ill patients. For usage and dosage, please refer to "Clinical Treatment Plan for Recovery Period of New Coronary Pneumonia Rehabilitation Patients (Trial Version 2)".

6. Blood purification treatment: The blood purification system includes plasma exchange, adsorption, perfusion, blood / plasma filtration, etc., which can remove inflammatory factors and block the "cytokine storm", thereby reducing the damage to the body caused by the inflammatory response. It can be used for heavy and critical Early and mid-term treatment of patients with cytokine storms.

7. Immunotherapy: For patients with extensive lung disease and severe patients, and laboratory testing workers with elevated L-6 levels, tocilizumab treatment can be tried. First dose
4-Bnig / kg, the recommended dosage is 400mg .. 0.9% saline diluted to 100m19
The injection time is more than 1 hour; if the first medication is not effective, it can be added after 12 hours

The volume is not more than 800ing. Pay attention to allergic reactions, and those with active infection such as tuberculosis are prohibited.

8. Other treatments
For patients with progressive deterioration of oxygenation indicators, rapid imaging progress, and excessive activation of the body's inflammatory response, use glucocorticoid for a short period of time (3,-,,-, 5) as appropriate
The recommended dose is not more than 1-2 mg / kg / day of methylprednisolone. It should be noted that larger doses of glucocorticoids will delay the removal of coronavirus due to the immunosuppressive effect; Xuebijing can be given intravenously 100inl / time Treatment 2 times a day; intestinal microecological regulators can be used to maintain intestinal microecological balance and prevent secondary bacterial infections.
Intravenous infusion of gamma globulin may be considered in children with severe and critical cases as appropriate
White.
Pregnant women with severe or critical neocoronavirus pneumonia should actively terminate pregnancy
Pregnant, Caesarean section is preferred.
