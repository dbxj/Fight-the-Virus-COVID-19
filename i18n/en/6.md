# Chapter 6 Clinical Typing

### (A) Lightweight
The clinical symptoms were mild, and no pneumonia manifested on imaging.

### (B) Ordinary Type
With fever, respiratory tract and other symptoms, imaging shows pneumonia.

### (C) Heavy
Adults meet any of the following:
1. Shortness of breath, RR≥30 times / minute;
2. In the resting state, means oxygen saturation ≤93%;
3. Arterial blood oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) / oxygen concentration (FiO2) ≤ 300mmHg (1mmHg = 0.133kPa).
At high altitudes (above 1000 meters), PaO2 / FiO2 should be corrected according to the following formula: PaO2 / FiO2 * [Atmospheric pressure (mmHg) / 760].

Pulmonary imaging showed that the lesions progressed significantly within 50-48 hours.

Children meet any of the following:
1. Shortness of breath (<2 months of age, RR≥60 beats / min; 2 to 12 months of age, RR≥50 beats / min; 115 years old, RR≥40 beats / min;> 5 years old, RR≥30 beats / min Points), except for the effects of fever and crying;
2. In the resting state, means oxygen saturation ≤92%;
3. Assisted breathing (groaning, wing flaps, triconcave sign), cyanosis, intermittent apnea;
4. Drowsiness and convulsions;
5. Refuse to feed or feed, with signs of dehydration.

### (D) Dangerous
Meet one of the following conditions;
1. Respiratory failure occurs and requires mechanical ventilation;
2. Appear shock
3. Combining other organ failures requires ICU monitoring and treatment.
