###(B) ordinary type.
With fever, respiratory tract and other symptoms, imaging shows pneumonia. 

###(C) Heavy.
Adults meet any of the following:
1. Shortness of breath occurs, RR? 30 times / minute;
2. In resting state, refers to 93% of hair saturation;
3. Partial arterial oxygen pressure (Pa02) / oxygen concentration (FlU2) extended by 300mmHg (1nlmHg = 0.133kPa).
At high altitudes (above 1000 meters), Pa02 / F102 should be corrected according to the following formula: Pa02 / F l02 '[Atm (inrnHg) / 7601.
Pulmonary imaging showed that the lesions progressed significantly within 50-48 hours.

Children meet any of the following:
1. Shortness of breath (<2 months of age, RR 60 times / min more; 2'12 months of age, RR) 50 times / min; 115 years old, RR? 40 times / minute;> 5 years old, RR? 30 times / minute Points), except
The effects of external fever and crying;

2. In a resting state, means a hair saturation of 92%;
3. Assisted breathing (groaning, wing flaps, triple concave sign), mixed, intermittent apnea;
4. Drowsiness and convulsions;
5. Refuse to feed or feed, with signs of dehydration.

###(D) Dangerous.
Meet one of the following conditions;
1. Respiratory failure occurs and requires mechanical ventilation;
2. Appear shock
3. Combining other organ failures requires' CU monitoring.
