# Chapter 2 Epidemiological characteristics

(1) Source of infection.
The sources of infection seen so far are mainly patients with new coronavirus infections. Asymptomatic infection can also be a source of infection.

(2) the way of transmission.
Respiratory droplets and close contact transmission are the main routes of transmission. There is the possibility of aerosol transmission in a relatively closed environment for a long time exposure to high concentrations of aerosol. As new coronaviruses can be isolated in feces and urine, attention should be paid to the environmental pollution caused by feces and urine to aerosol or contact transmission.

(3) Susceptible people.
The crowd is generally susceptible.
