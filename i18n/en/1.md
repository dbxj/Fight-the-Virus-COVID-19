# Chapter 1 Etiological characteristics

New coronaviruses belong to the coronavirus of the genus p, which have an envelope, and the particles are round or oval, often polymorphic, with a diameter of 60-l4Onm. Its genetic characteristics are significantly different from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Current research shows that it has more than 85% homology with bat SARS-like coronavirus (bat-SL-CoVZC45). When isolated and cultured in vitro, the new coronavirus can be found in human respiratory epithelial cells in about 96 hours, while it takes about 6 days to isolate and culture in Vera E6 and Hnh-7 cell lines.

Most of the knowledge about the physical and chemical properties of coronavirus comes from the research on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The virus is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat. For 30 minutes at 56C, ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, peracetic acid, and chloroform can effectively inactivate the virus. Chlorhexidine cannot effectively inactivate the virus.
